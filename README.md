MY PHILOSOPHY
======

In writing code, I believe that it should be written in the way it is meant to be written. My philosphy is parallel to the beliefs of Douglas Crockford (author of "JavaScript: The Good Parts").

This is what I believe is "show off" code:

  1. Code that is easy to read and follow
  2. Code where veriables and objects are named logically and appropirate to presence.
  3. Code that produces as near as it can to zero errors.
  4. Code that if it does produce errors, if efficently written to debug.
  5. Code that has relevant and sufficient comments so someone else can understand, debug, and edit the code efficiently
  6. Code that minimally confuses anyone who reads it.
  7. Code that doesn't compromise friendlyness or reliability for the sake of file size.
